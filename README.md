## DiamondSquare

A quick weekend project I wrote to have some fun with XNA.  It generates 3D terrain using the Diamond-Square algorithm.
A random seed is used for each generation, which allows for the visualization of different levels of roughness.

### Keys

* Up/Down - Increase/decrease roughness
* Spacebar - Enable/disable rotation
* Enter - Generate new terrain
